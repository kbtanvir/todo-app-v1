# Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built with React (client) and Flask (server) using Docker Compose.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

### Directory Structure

Ensure your directory structure looks like this:

```
todo-app/
├── client/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── (other client app files)
├── server/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── (other server app files)
└── docker-compose.yml
```

## Docker Compose Configuration

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory (`todo-app/`) with the following content:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  client:
    container_name: todo-app-client
    build:
      context: ./client
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    depends_on:
      - server

  server:
    container_name: todo-app-server
    build:
      context: ./server
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

## Building and Running the Application

1. **Build and Run Docker Compose:**

   From the root directory (`todo-app/`), run the following command to build and start the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the Docker images for the client and server apps defined in their respective `Dockerfile`s and start containers for both services.

2. **Accessing the Applications:**

   - **Client App:** Access the React client app in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
   
   - **Server App:** The Flask server app with SQLAlchemy will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

3. **Swagger Documentation:**

   - **Swagger UI:** After starting the server, you can access the Swagger UI to view the API documentation at [http://localhost:5000/apidocs](http://localhost:5000/apidocs).

## Stopping the Application

To stop the Docker containers running the applications, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where `docker-compose up` is running. This will stop the containers gracefully.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure your client app (`./client`) and server app (`./server`) directories contain valid `Dockerfile` configurations tailored to build and run each respective application within its Docker container.

```

### Explanation

- **Swagger Documentation:** Added a section detailing how to access the Swagger UI generated by `flasgger` after starting the server. Users can visit [http://localhost:5000/apidocs](http://localhost:5000/apidocs) in their browser to interactively explore the API documentation.

Including this section in your `README.md` provides clear instructions on how to use Swagger to explore your API endpoints, enhancing the usability and understanding of your Todo application. Adjust the URLs and paths according to your specific setup if necessary.
